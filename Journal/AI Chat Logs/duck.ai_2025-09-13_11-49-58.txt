What is this python question asking for? "Given title and author, print a fixed‑width label so titles

align. Example: Title: {title:30} Author: {author:20}."

Let me break down this Python formatting question for you:

## Python String Formatting Challenge

The question is asking you to create a label printing mechanism with the following specifications:

### Key Requirements
- <b>Use fixed-width formatting</b> for printing titles and authors
- <b>Align the titles within a specified width</b>
- <b>Use Python's string formatting capabilities</b>

### Example Explanation
In the example `Title: {title:30} Author: {author:20}`:
- <b>`:30`</b> means the title will be allocated 30 characters of width
- <b>`:20`</b> means the author will be allocated 20 characters of width
- If the title is shorter than 30 characters, it will be right-padded with spaces by default
- If the title is longer than 30 characters, it will be truncated

### Sample Implementation
```python
title = "The Great Gatsby"
author = "F. Scott Fitzgerald"

print(f"Title: {title:30} Author: {author:20}")
```

This would output the title and author with fixed widths, ensuring consistent alignment across multiple book entries.

The core goal is to create a neat, aligned label printing system that works consistently regardless of the length of individual titles or author names.
